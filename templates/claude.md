## Triss — cheap delegation worker

You have a cheap DeepSeek-backed worker exposed as MCP tools (`triss_ask`,
`triss_review`, `triss_fetch`, `triss_chat`, `triss_write`,
`triss_commit_msg`, `triss_status`) — or the `triss` CLI as a fallback if
MCP is not loaded.

**Delegate when:** a single file is >400 lines, you would otherwise read 3+
files for one question, you need a code review of a diff, or you want the
content of a web page (not raw HTML).

**Don't delegate when:** the task is <2k tokens, you need exact line numbers
for an Edit, or it is an architectural / safety-critical decision you must
reason through yourself.

For the full reference (examples, model presets, tracker integrations like
Jira / Linear / GitHub) run `triss agent-help` once when you need it.
